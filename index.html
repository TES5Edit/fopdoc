<p>The Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas plugin file formats are all very similar, but while there
    exists good documentation for <a
            href="http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Mod_File_Format">Oblivion<a/>, there is no equivalent for Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. The aim is for this repository to become that equivalent.</p>

<h3>Conventions:</h3>

<p>The conventions used by this documentation are given in  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Conventions.html">Conventions
</a>. Data structure
    definitions are found in one of the following subfolders:</p>

<p>Each record type is documented in a separate file. Subrecords that share the same structure across multiple record
    types are documented in separate files, while those unique to a particular record are documented in that record's file.</p>

<h3>Format:</h3>

<p>This documentation is written in <a
        href="https://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>
    and stored in a Git repository on <a href="http://tes5edit.github.io/fopdoc")>GitHub</a> because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revision control is good.</li>
<li>You can download the documentation for offline reading.</li>
<li>Markdown gives readable plain text and can also be readily converted to HTML.</li>
<li>GitHub offers in-browser editing and HTML preview for Markdown.</li>
<li>GitHub makes it easier to make, share and integrate edits with others.</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Format Data Source:</h3>

<p>The most complete open-source implementation of plugin parsers for these games is
    <a href="https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit">TES5Edit</a>, written in Delphi. The
        information on the
    file formats contained within its parsing code has been adapted into a reasonably generic format that programmers
    should be able to interpret regardless of their preferred language, similar to how it is presented by
    <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes5Mod:Mod_File_Format">UESP.net</a>.</p>

<p>This documentation was written to reflect the TES5Edit source code on 2 June 2014.</p>
